# Stable-Matching-
Stable Matching Algorithm using a Linked Stack : O(n^2) 
This is the infamous Stable Matching algorithm implemented using a Stack Class.
With every operation in a stack being constant time, it makes the time complexity of this implementation of the Stable
Matching algorithm O(n^2).
